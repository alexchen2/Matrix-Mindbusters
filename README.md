# Matrix Mindbusters
Matrix Mindbusters is an educational game aimed to help undergraduate Math & Engineering students learn matrix transformations. Written in Elm, the program was created in 2023 for a summative assignment in McMaster's computer science undergraduate course COMPSCI 1XD3, and it utilizes MacCAS Outreach's GraphicSVG library to render images and vector shapes (created by McMaster students and Dr. Christopher Anand).
